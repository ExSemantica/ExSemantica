Open-source link aggregator.

## Guidance

Builds upon [the previous eactivitypub][eactivitypub] repository.
This is a mix of incomplete pieces `v0.7` (a Phoenix 1.5 monolithic codebase) and `v0.8` (using Mnesia).
Together these make a great concept for a simple, reliable social platform at edge.
This is what I see and hope in `v0.9`, but failure is okay.

## How to use this?

This part of the guide will be rewritten soon...
